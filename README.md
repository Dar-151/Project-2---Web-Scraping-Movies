# Project-2---Web-Scraping-Movies
From the website of your choice, setup a web scraping pipeline to scrape data from at least five pages. Place the data in a pandas DataFrame, clean the data, if necessary, and then perform data analysis that answers a minimum of four questions about the data.
# I wanted to do all my questions for my wiki websites
# The questions
# Question 1: Which year from 2020-2025 had the highest box office?


# Question 2: How did the top gross change from each year?


# Question 3: Which studio appeared in the top 10 across the 6 years?


# Question 4: Which film had the highest gross of all?



# Question 5: Which percentage of the top 10 films each year were released by Disney?
