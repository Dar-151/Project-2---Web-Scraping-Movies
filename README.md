# Project-2---Web-Scraping-Movies
From the website of your choice, setup a web scraping pipeline to scrape data from at least five pages. Place the data in a pandas DataFrame, clean the data, if necessary, and then perform data analysis that answers a minimum of four questions about the data.
For my project I scraped data from 5 different Wikipedia sources and I analyzed the movies from each of them. After I scraped the data I cleaned it and then plotted them. 
# I wanted to do all my questions for my wiki websites
# The questions
### Question 1: Which year from 2020–2025 had the highest box office?
The year 2022 had the highest total box office with a gross of about $4.1 billion across the top 10 movies of the year.  
2024 was in close second with around $3.9 billion.

### Question 2: How did the top gross change from each year?
I used a line chart to show the top single film each year.  
The gross increased a lot from 2020 to 2021 and peaked in 2022, then slowly declined after that.

### Question 3: Which studio appeared in the top 10 across the six years?
Disney had the most appearances (15 movies in total), followed by Universal and Warner Bros.  
Disney clearly dominated the top-grossing films over this time period.

### Question 4: Which film had the highest gross of all?
Spider-Man: No Way Home had the highest domestic gross across all the years.  
It was in first by a large margin.

### Question 5: Which percentage of the top 10 films each year were released by Disney?
I calculated the percentage and found that Disney made up around 40–50% of the top 10 films in the most recent years.  
This shows how strong their presence is in the box office.
